Love is...

# project overview
“Love is…” is dedicated to the Biblical passage 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. This passage is one of the most popular verses among Christians and even non-Christians because it is a reminder of what we as a community are supposed to act like. However, too many of us act like the complete opposite of it. We discriminate against others based on race, gender, sexuality, physical appearances, religion, and even denomination. Hate is what separates us, which isn’t what Jesus would approve of. *Unconditional* love is what brings us together, and we must learn how to put aside our differences to make the world a better place.
